          <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
          <p>Over the lockdown, some businesses and companies experienced many changes in the way they operate, and the profits of these firms seemed to either plummet or sky rocket.
          A company who's profits sky rocketed includes Amazon who's stock price went very high as shown in the graph below which I made using python.</p>
          <img src="amzn.png" style="width:45%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Amazon stock price 16/02/20 to 10/07/20 - annotating with plt.annotate()">
          <p>People have turned to the online shopping lifestyle to buy items, and Amazon has taken huge advantage of this since, basically, if you want anything it is probably there.
          With the millions more people who signed up to Amazon over the lockdown, Amazon was launched into huge growth in demand leading the company
          to reap the rewards of $11,000 per second. Therefore, they had to hire almost 1,300,000 people for delivery driving
          or working in the packing centres to keep up. Furthermore, Amazon web services also took off since the amount of people using this business break as an opportunity to get their websites going.
          Overall, the amount of people having to do their groceries and spending their money turned to Amazon, causing a big spike in prices. After all of this pandemonium of demand and profit for Amazon
        , Bezos has become the first person to be worth $200,000,000,000, even though before covid-19 he sold $3.4 billion worth of Amazon stock.</p>
