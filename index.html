    <h2><a href="thelab.html">Link to the whole jupyter lab</A></h2>
    <p><b>The highlights of using jupyter lab for python</b></p>
    <p><b>I started using Jupyter lab because while learning python in school, I wanted to go a step further and start learning to use other libraries such as numpy, matplotlib or pandas which was much easier to use using
      a notebook like jupyter - you can also click any of the pictures to zoom in.
    </b></p>
    <p>My first step in using matplotlib was to create basic graphs either linear or quadratic which could also help me in learning maths since I can easily create a graph using an equation or a
    set of points. I firstly made a simple linear graph which looked like this.</p>

    <img src="code.png" style="width:30%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Linear graph code">The basic linear graph code
    <p>After learning the absolute basics of matplotlib through courses on freecodecamp.org or random youtube videos that I had found, I learnt other graph styles and the ability to put them
    in rows , all in the same cell.</p>
    <img src="jup.png" style="width:60%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Stacking graphs horizontally">Stacking different styles of graphs
    <p>To end off my matplotlib journey, I learnt how to use csv files which would have data, for instance, about the price of etherium and bitcoin from 2017 which would show their price
    and on what day it took to get their.</p>

          <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
          <p>Over lockdown some business and companies eperienced many changes in the way they do business and some campanies' profits either plummeted or sky rocketed.
          A company who's profits sky rocketed includes Amazon who's stock price went very high as shown in the graph below which I made using python.</p>

          <p>Since people have turned to the online shopping lifestyle to buy items and amazon has taken huge advantage of this since, basically, if you want an item it is probably on amazon.
          With the millions more people who signed up to amazon over lockdown, amazon found an unexpected huge growth of demand leading to the company
          to reap the rewards of $11,000 per second. Therefore, they had to hire many more people for delivery driving
          or working in the factories to supply all of this demand. Furthmore, amazon web serives also took off since the amount of people using this business break as an opportunity to get their websites going.
          Overall, the amount of people having to do their groceries and spending their money turned to amazon causing a big spike of price. After all of this pandemonium of demand and profit for amazon
        , Bezos has become the first person to be worth $200,000,000,000, even though before covid-19 he sold $3.4 billion worth of amazon stock.</p>

          <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Monopolies.</b></h1>
          <p>Monopolies exist every where in the world from poor to rich economies. For instance, the national grid which supplies everyone in Great Britain electricity.
          But if you think about it, they do have a pure monopoly since they are the largest output of electricity and no other company is as large as them.
          </p>
          <p>Furthmore, it is vital that the national grid is government owned sice if you can imagine it was owned by a private company, then that would be chaos since
          they would just be able to determine their own prices; this would be damaging for the economy since many people would have to take loans since there would be no
          other competition. This is why governments believe that these kind of markets are so important for the economy that they nationalised these markets in the 1940's by the Labour government.
          Governments may also purposefully create private monopolies like television broadcasting. This regulates consumption of the service and theoretically the government would be able to maintain high
          standards. This is an example of a natural monopoly since the start up costs are so high that is dissuades other buyers from entering the market.</p>
          <p>Monoposonies are where a market can be controlled and dominated by a single buyer. Even though there are monopsonies like google which can be an example of as one, they also exist where
          only people with the education and skill can do the job. For instance, let's say becoming a train conductor is so difficult that only a few hundred people in a city could become one.
          This would create a monopsony since the supply is controlled by these conductors and if they wish to go on strike, there would be no one else to replace them since only they can do it.</p>

          <p>Another case of monopolisation was the black cabs since they could be so easily hailed down on the road to call a very experienced driver who had to complete a rigorous London streets
          test where they would be able to drive from any point to another in London without using a navigator. These black cab drivers were deliberately kept in short supply.Although a few smaller companies
          have tried to compete, nothing has come close until the arrival of "Uber". As they boasted about benefits like cheaper prices and a driver a few buttons on the app away,
          Uber was damaging the black cabs monopoly with the help of smartphones to create the power shift. Furthermore, the Uber app or website allowed the customer to see the driver, vehicle details,
          pricing on the app and contact number it seemed like the obvious answer to get an Uber insead of a black cab.</p>

          <p>Overall, monopolies exist everywhere in many types where they can be beneficial or disadvantageous for the people since if there is competition, they can compete against one another the price
          of the good was slowly come down since one company lowers it, then so does the other; however, benefits can include how these companies or governments can ensure standards for the service or good.</p>

  <h2>Circles</h2>
  <img src="circle.png" style="width:30%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Using python to create the circle in the question below">
  <p>If we have (𝑥-3)<sup>2</sup> + (y+4)<sup>2</sup> = 20 - then we would be able to find the centre of the circle by using the negatives of the numbers after 𝑥 and y
  so the centre's coordinates are (3,-4). </p>
  <p>If we wanted to prove that the circle passes through the point (5,-8) then we could just substitute in 𝑥=5 and y=-8 into the equation.</p>
  <p>(5-3)<sup>2</sup> + (-8 + 4)<sup>2</sup> = 4 + 16, which equals 20, therefore, it works with the equation and the circle passes through the point.</p>

  <h3>Next question</h3>

  <img src="alevelcircle.png" style="width:38%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Exam circles question">
  <p>Edexcel A level pure maths 2018 paper 1 Q6</p>
  <p>Starting off with the first question, since we know the equation of the tangent, we can use it to find the equation of the line which is perpendicular to it.</p>
  <p>We will find the negative reciprocal of the gradient of the tangent ,so, the gradient of PA is -&frac12;𝑥. So far the line's equation is y = -&frac12;𝑥 + c</p>
  <p>Now that we have the gradient and a point on the line (7,5), we can subsitute it in.</p>
  <p>By subsituting, we get 5 = -3.5 + c. Therefore c must equal 8.5 to make the equation true.</p>
  <p>Even though we now know the line's equation which is y = -&frac12;𝑥 + 8.5,  we have to put in into the form specified in the question with the method below.</p>
  <p>2y = -𝑥 + 17</p>
  <p>2y + 𝑥 = 17</p>

  <h4>Now question B:</h4>
  <p>In order to find the equation of the circle we must use the formula for it which is (x-x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+ (y-y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup> where x1 and y1 represents coordinates of the centre.</p>
  <p>We will need to find the radius - we can do this by using simultaneous equations with the equations we already know in order to find point P.</p>
  <p>If equation 1 : y = 2𝑥 + 1</p>
  <p>If equation 2 : 2y + 𝑥 = 17 and we subsitute 1 into 2:</p>
  <p>2(2𝑥 + 1) + 𝑥 = 17 - we do this because we know what y equals so we can subsitute it in.</p>
  <p>This simplifies to 5𝑥 = 15 where 𝑥 = 3</p>
  <p>Now that we know what 𝑥 equals, we can subsitute it into the first equation where we get y = 7</p>
  <p>So, point P is (3,7)</p>
  <p>we use this to find the radius by using pythagoras' theorem.</p>
  <p>So, 16 + 4 = 20 which is the radius squared.</p>
  <p>Using the formula of a circle, the equation is (𝑥-7)<sup>2</sup> + (y-5)<sup>2</sup> = 20</p>

  <h4>Now question C:</h4>
  <p>We can see that line k has the same gradient, so, it must be parallel with line l, so we can draw the tangent on the circle where it is still parallel to line l.</p>
  <img src="added.png" style="width:30%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Extra tangent to the circle.">
  <p>We need to find the point on the tangent and line(marked in red in the image above).</p>
  <p>The displacement from point P (the original point which linked the first tangent to the circle) must be the same to the red point as it is the radius.</p>
  <p>Since the difference from point P to the radius is to +4 the x coordinate and -2 with the y coordinate. Therefore, if we use that method from the radius to the red point, it must be (11,3)</p>
  <P>Now, in order to find k we can subsitute in (11,3) into y = 2𝑥 + k</P>
  <p>We get 3 = 22 + k , so, k must equal -19</p>
  <p>k = -19 and the line equation is y = 2𝑥 - 19</p>


  <h2>Next question - C2 Edexcel June 2012 Q3</h2>
  <img src="morecircle.PNG" style="width:38%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Another circles question.">
  <p></p>
  <p>Since the equation of the circle is 𝑥<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> - 20𝑥 -16y + 139 = 0, we can "complete the sqaure" to put it in the normal equation of a circle.</p>
  <p>(𝑥 - 10)<sup>2</sup>- 100 + (y - 8)<sup>2</sup> -64 + 139 = 0</p>
  <p>Which can simplify to (𝑥-10)<sup>2</sup> + (y-8)<sup>2</sup> -25 = 0, which simplifies to (𝑥 - 10)<sup>2</sup> + (y - 8)<sup>2</sup> = 25</p>
  <p>Therefore, the coordinates of the centre of the circle are (10,8) and the centre is the <span>&#8730;25</span> which is 5. Circle radius is 5.</p>
  <p>C) Using (𝑥 - 10)<sup>2</sup> + (y - 8)<sup>2</sup> = 25 we can substitute in x = 13</p>
  <p>Which brings us (13-10)<sup>2</sup> + (y-8)<sup>2</sup> = 25</p>
  <p>Which equals 9 + (y-8)<sup>2</sup> = 25</p>
  <p>(y-8)<sup>2</sup> = 16</p>
  <p>y-8 = &plusmn;4 therefore y = &plusmn;4 + 8</p>
  <p>So, point Q has y coordinate of 4 and point P has y coordinate of 12</p>
  <p>d) Find the perimeter of the sector:</p>
  <img src="working.png" style="width:38%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Adding lines to the sector">
  <p>We already know that a red line is equal to the radius, so they equal 5 each.</p>
  <p>Using radians to find the arc length we can use the formula &thetasym;/2π * 2πr.</p>
  <p>So, 1.855/2π * 2πr = 9.275 - you can also cancel out the "2π"s as well.</p>
  <p>As a result, 9.275 + 5 + 5 = 19.275 which is the perimeter of the sector PTQ.</p>

  <h2>Last circles question - Edexcel C2 Jan 2010 Q8</h2>
  <img src="figure.PNG" style="width:38%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="The circle">
  <img src="questions.PNG" style="width:38%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="The quesitons about the circle above">
  <p>a) (2,-1)</p>
  <p>b) radius equals <span>&#8730;</span> 169&frasl;4 - so the radius can be expressed as 13/2 which is 6.5</p>
  <img src="diagram.PNG" style="width:30%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Labelled circle">I will be referring to this diagram in question c)
  <p>c) We can make a line from N to line AB and split line AB into two lines going a distance of 6 in each direction.</p>
  <p>This helps us since we can add or subtract 6(the distance in each direction) from 2(which is the x coordinate of the radius).</p>
  <p>The blue point in the diagram above has x coordinate of 2 - 6 = 4, so far it has coordinates of (-4, ?)</p>
  <p>And the green point has coordinates (8, ?)</p>
  <p>In order to find the y coordinates, we can subsitute in the x coordinate into the circle's formula to satisfy the equation and get a y coordinates.</p>
  <p>We can use (8, ?), so, using the circle's formula of (𝑥-2)<sup>2</sup> + (y+1)<sup>2</sup> = 169/4 we get:</p>
  <p>36 + (y+1)<sup>2</sup> = 169/4</p>
  <p>(y+1)<sup>2</sup> = 25/4</p>
  <p>y+1 = &plusmn;25/4 - which can be expressed as y + 1 = &plusmn;5/2</p>
  <p>y = &plusmn;45/2 - 1</p>
  <p>So, the two y coordinates for the points are either 1.5 or -3.5; we can use the fact that the points are both under the y axis and share the same y point, therefore, both points have y coordinates of -3.5.</p>
  <p>So, point A has coordinates of (-4, -3.5) and point B has coordinates of (8, -3.5)</p>
